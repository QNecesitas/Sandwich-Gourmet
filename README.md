## Note

This code has been made public because our development company responsible for this project has permanently closed. As a result, all contracts and projects with clients, including this one, were discontinued.  
The application does not contain any sensitive information related to the client, and it has been shared just as part of the company's portfolio to enhance the creators' curriculums.
